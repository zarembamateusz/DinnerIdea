# Dinner Idea
App is still in progres.
In next few hours will be added iOS part, fixes in Android and tests.

## Description
Dinner Idea is a simple demo application (created in less than 5 hours) in which the user can get an idea for dinner. The application is built in KMP technology (using the Kotlin and Swift languages), and additionally uses Kotlin Flows, Coroutines, JetPack Compose, Swift UI and Mockativo. Soon the application will be expanded with a library for dependency injection and the locally hardcoded meal list will be replaced with dynamic meal list delivery from Firebase. Firebase integration will also enable users to log into the app.
